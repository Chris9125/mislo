# Mislo Study Project
## The main branch is the first version of the project
This project is a Social Network, where I implenented tha backend using Flask and Flask_Websocket.
<br>
There are few functionalities in the website, like posting, instant messages, excluding your posts etc...
<br>
It was a really cool experience as I am not a developer, and I didn't know that much about Front-end and Back-end.
<br>
I tried my best implementing the features and the results are pretty decent, even though the project has some bugs.
<br>
I really learned a lot about SQL, and how to implement a Back-end and develop something from zero.
